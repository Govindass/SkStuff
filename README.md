## Unofficial fork of [SkStuff](https://github.com/TheBukor/SkStuff)

As the owner is missing for a few weeks, this fork brings nbt support to 1.12. Only use it in case the official one still not supported.

**Download it [here](/releases)**

In case of **bugs**:
 * If it is a bug related to NBTs or Pathfind and it only happens in 1.12, you can report it here and I will try to help.
 * Any other bugs, should be reported at official pages. Since it is a temporary fork.
