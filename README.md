## Unofficial fork of [SkStuff](https://github.com/TheBukor/SkStuff)

This fork adds 1.13.2 and 1.14.2 support, removes support for older than 1.13 versions, removes worldguard/worldedit, vanishnospacket and nbt stuff. This fork is focused on making pathfinder goals to work as they are unique to SkStuff. Note that I'm not very experienced Java developer yet, so it is possible that I have made some mistakes, but from my little testings things are working.
